## Overview

`aws_saaco3_set` is a React project designed to help you prepare for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03) exam. This practice exam set contains 65 multiple-choice questions that closely match the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam format.

The questions cover a wide range of AWS services, best practices, security, networking, databases, and more. They are designed to test both theoretical knowledge and real-world scenario application.

This project uses the practice questions generated by using the **Gemini** model, and the prompt used is in src/assets/prompt.txt.

**Note:** The questions are designed to closely align with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam (SAA-C03), but they should not be considered official exam material. Always refer to the AWS official documentation for the most up-to-date information and exam objectives.
